Here

Input Layer: Accepts images of size 128x128 pixels with three color channels (RGB).

Convolutional Layers:
32 filters of size 3x3, using ReLU activation function.
Followed by max-pooling with a 2x2 window to reduce spatial dimensions.

Flattening Layer: 
Flattens the output from the convolutional layers into a 1D array to feed into the densely connected layers.

Densely Connected Layers:
First dense layer with 256 neurons and ReLU activation.
Dropout layer with a rate of 0.5 to reduce overfitting.
Second dense layer with 512 neurons and ReLU activation.
Final dense layer with 5 neurons, using the softmax activation function for multi-class classification (outputting probabilities for 5 classes).

Optimizer: Adam optimizer is used
Loss function: Sparse categorical cross-entropy, which is suitable for multi-class classification.
Metrics: Accuracy, to evaluate the model's performance during training.

Training:
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=40, batch_size=128, validation_split=0.1)
Here the model is trained for 40 epochs with batch size of 128
Evaluation:
Here we evaluated the model on the test data and a classification report was generated
The accuracy was recorded as 76%

Prediction:

A function "predict_celebrity" was created in order to take the user input image a preprocessed for predicting the celebrity
And we can observe that the model is predicting correctly the celebrities among the inputed image
